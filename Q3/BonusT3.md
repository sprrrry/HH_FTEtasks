# Bonus: Reducing I/O Pins Usage

To reduce the number of I/O pins used on the Arduino, consider the following methods:

## 1. Shift Registers
Use shift registers to control multiple segments via serial communication, significantly reducing the number of direct I/O connections.

### Benefits
- Control multiple outputs with just 3 Arduino pins.
- Easily expandable by chaining multiple shift registers together.

### Steps
1. **Connect the shift register to the Arduino using SPI.**
2. **Send segment data serially to the shift register.**
3. **Latch the output to display the digit.**

## 2. I2C/SPI Display Drivers
Use specialized ICs like the MAX7219 or HT16K33 to drive multiple 7-segment displays with minimal pins.

### Benefits
- Reduces complexity.
- Libraries simplify implementation.

### Steps
1. **Connect the driver to the Arduino using I2C or SPI.**
2. **Configure driver settings in the code.**
3. **Use libraries to control the display.**

These methods provide efficient ways to reduce the number of I/O pins required for driving multiple 7-segment displays.
