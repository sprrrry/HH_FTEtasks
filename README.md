# AVR Projects for Arduino

This repository contains solutions for various tasks implemented for AVR microcontrollers using avr-gcc and Makefiles. The projects are written in pure C at the bare-metal level without using the Arduino library.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Task 1**: Blink an LED on an Arduino board.
2. **Task 2**: Write an 8-bit Fibonacci sequence counter and display the output using an LED array.
    - **Bonus**: Explain how to scale this approach for 32-bit numbers.
3. **Task 3**: Extend Task 2 to display the counter output using an array of 7-segment displays.
    - **Bonus**: Reduce the number of I/Os used on the Arduino.
4. **Task 4**: Build a system with two Arduino boards communicating over SPI. Board A sends a pair of numbers (x, y) to Board B, which performs an arithmetic operation based on y and returns the result.
    - **Bonus**: Implement an ACK/NACK mechanism for SPI transactions to handle invalid commands and edge cases.
