## Scaling Fibonacci Sequence Counter for 32-bit Numbers

To scale the Fibonacci sequence counter for 32-bit numbers using LED arrays, the following steps will be taken:

### 1. Use Multiple LED Arrays
- **Four 8-LED arrays** will be used, each representing one byte of the 32-bit number.
- This setup divides the 32-bit number into manageable 8-bit segments, making it easier to display.

### 2. Implement Shift Registers
- **Shift registers** (e.g., 74HC595) will be used to control the LED arrays.
- Each shift register will handle one 8-LED array, allowing us to manage multiple LEDs with fewer microcontroller I/O pins.
- The shift registers will be **daisy-chained**, enabling the serial output of one register to feed into the input of the next.

### 3. Efficient Data Handling
- The 32-bit number will be broken down into **four 8-bit segments**.
- Each 8-bit segment will be sent to its respective LED array through the shift registers.
- This method ensures that each LED array correctly displays its portion of the 32-bit number.

### 4. Scalability
- The approach can be extended beyond 32-bit numbers by adding more 8-LED arrays and shift registers.
- This modular design allows for easy scaling without significant changes to the hardware or software setup.

By using multiple 8-LED arrays controlled by shift registers, we can efficiently display 32-bit Fibonacci numbers while minimizing the required I/O pins on the microcontroller. This scalable method ensures clarity and modularity, making it suitable for handling larger numbers as needed.
